<h1> Shopee Clone Side Project </h1>

- Back-end is made with Laravel 10 <br>
- Front-end is styled with Tailwind CSS


<h1>Features present</h1>
1. Basic CRUD operations for the product. (Create, View, Update/Edit, Delete/Destroy a product).
2. Each product has an independent stocks and sold count.
3. Each product have independent reviews and based on the product_id.
4. Search bars are functional and you can search a product by its name.
5. It is responsive enough to fit in any screen but not stylish enough (personal preference).

 <h1> Future features to be implemented soon </h1>
1. Login system. Where you can login as an admin or a user which have different operations depending on the account type.
2. Cart system. Where a user can add product on his/her cart and can check it out.
3. User Auth.
4. Still thinking of what features I should put. You can freely comment on my this commit to suggest some!
