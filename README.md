<h1> Shopee Clone Side Project </h1>

- Back-end is made with Laravel 10 <br>
- Front-end is styled with Tailwind CSS


<h1>Features present</h1>
1. Basic CRUD operations for the product. (Create, View, Update/Edit, Delete/Destroy a product).  <br>  <br>
2. Each product has an independent stocks and sold count.  <br>  <br>
3. Each product have independent reviews and based on the product_id.  <br>  <br>
4. Search bars are functional and you can search a product by its name.  <br>  <br>
5. It is responsive enough to fit in any screen but not stylish enough (personal preference).  <br>  <br>
6. 2. Cart system. Where a user can add product on his/her cart and can check it out. <br>  <br>
 <br>
  <br>
 <h1> Future features to be implemented soon </h1>  <br>  <br>
1. Login system. Where you can login as an admin or a user which have different operations depending on the account type.  <br>  <br>
3. User Auth.  <br>  <br>
4. Still thinking of what features I should put. You can freely comment on my this commit to suggest some!   <br>  <br>



Note: Development stopped Dec, 17, 2023 because I have lost the motivation again for coding XD
